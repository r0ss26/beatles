  <p>
    The Beatles were an English rock band that became arguably the most successful act of the 20th century.
    They contributed to music, film, literature, art, and fashion, made a continuous impact on popular
    culture and the lifestyle of several generations. Their songs and images carrying powerful ideas of
    love, peace, help, and imagination evoked creativity and liberation that outperformed the rusty Soviet
    propaganda and contributed to breaking walls in the minds of millions, thus making impact on human history.
