    The Beatles were an English rock band that became arguably the most successful act of the 20th century. 
    They contributed to music, film, literature, art, and fashion, made a continuous impact on popular culture 
    and the lifestyle of several generations. Their songs and images carrying powerful ideas of love, peace, help, 
    and imagination evoked creativity and liberation that outperformed the rusty Soviet propaganda and contributed 
    to breaking walls in the minds of millions, thus making impact on human history.

    In July of 1957, in Liverpool, Paul McCartney met John Lennon. Both were teenagers. Paul impressed John with his 
    mastery of acoustic guitar, and was invited to join Lennon's group, The Quarrymen. George Harrison joined them in 
    February of 1958. In 1959 they played regular gigs at a club called The Casbah. They were joined by vocalist Stuart 
    Sutcliffe, and by drummer Peter Best, whose mother owned The Casbah club. Early incarnations of the band included 
    The Quarrymen, Johnny & the Moon Dogs, and The Silver Beetles. John Lennon dreamed up the band's final name, The Beatles, 
    a mix of beat with beetle. In 1960 The Beatles toured in Hamburg, Germany. There they were joined by Ringo Starr, 
    who previously played with Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. In Hamburg, The Beatles made their first studio work as a 
    backing band for singer Tony Sheridan's recordings for the German Polydor label, however, in the credits the band's 
    name was changed to The Beat Brothers. From February 1961 to August 1963, The Beatles played a regular gig at the Cavern. 
    They were paid five pounds for their first show, rising to three hundred pounds per show in 1963. In two and a half years 
    The Beatles gave 262 shows at the Cavern in Liverpool.

    Brian Epstein was invited to be the manager of the Beatles in November 1961. His diplomatic way of dealing with the Beatles 
    and with their previous manager resulted in a December 10, 1961, meeting, where it was decided that Epstein would manage the band. 
    A 5-year management contract was signed by four members at then-drummer Pete Best's home on January 24, 1962. Epstein did not 
    put his signature on it, giving the musicians the freedom of choice. At that time McCartney and Harrison were under 21, so the paper 
    wasn't technically legal. None of them realized this and it did not matter to them. What mattered was their genuine trust in Epstein. 
    He changed their early image for the good. Brian Epstein made them wear suits and ties, classic shoes, and newer haircuts. They were 
    advised to update their manners on stage and quit eating and drinking in public. Brian Epstein worked hard on both the Beatles' image 
    and public relations. He improved their image enough to make them accepted by the conservative media. Most if not all of their communication 
    off-stage was managed by Brian Epstein.

    On January 1, 1962, The Beatles came to London and recorded fifteen songs at the Decca Records. They were not hired, but the material 
    helped them later. During the year 1962, they made several trips to London and auditioned for various labels. In May of 1962 Epstein 
    canceled the group's contract with Tony Sheridan and the German label. Brian Epstein was persistent in trying to sign a record deal for 
    the Beatles, even after being rejected by every major record label in UK, like Columbia, Philips, Oriole, Decca, and Pye. Epstein transferred 
    a demo tape to disc with HMV technician Jim Foy, who liked their song and referred it to Parlophone's George Martin. On June 6, 1962, at the 
    Abbey Road studios, they passed Martin's audition with the exception of Pete Best. George Martin liked them, but recommended the change of a 
    drummer. Being asked by John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison; Epstein fired Pete Best. After a mutual decision the band was completed 
    with Ringo Starr, who duly became the fourth Beatle. In September of 1962 The Beatles recorded their first hit Love Me Do, which charted in UK, 
    and reached the top of the US singles chart.
